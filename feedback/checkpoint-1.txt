=====================
Class 3 - Group 34

If you believe this is an error, contact your class teacher.
=====================

High-priority:
	- "a.size = 10;" should be a semantic error, not a syntactic one.
	- Tree Annotation is incomplete:
		- In Term(), there is no way to obtain the sign of the expression, so it's not possible to distinguish "1" from "-1".
		- In Call(), the name of the called function is not stored
	- Error Recovery is incomplete: consider aval4_err.yal

Low-priority:
	- Consider outputting "prettier" (i.e., cleaner and more informative) error messages.
	- Message says "Reading from standard input", but the compiler reads the input from a file instead.
